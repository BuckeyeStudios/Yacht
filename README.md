## Yacht
Yacht is a container management UI with a focus on templates and 1-click deployments.

## Demo:
![Tempaltes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht/master/readme_media/Yacht-Demo.gif "templates")

## Installation:
Currently only linux has been verified as working but we are open to the idea of supporting windows eventually as well.

**Keep in mind, this is an alpha so the risk of data loss is real and it may not be stable**

Once docker is installed you'll simply run the following commands to get started:
```
docker volume create yacht
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v yacht:/config selfhostedpro/yacht
```
It will be available on port 8000.

The default login is `admin@yacht.local` and `pass` you should change this immediately by clicking on admin in the top right and then "User" then select "Change Password" in the top menu. You can also change your username using this field.

If you need to reset your password/username to the included defaults, please delete your yacht volume and create a new one (you will lose all of your configurations so be sure to backup when you make changes).

## Features So Far:
* Container Templating Compatibility (Portainer Compatible)
* Vuetify UI Framework
* Basic Container Management
* Template Framework
* Easy Template Updating
* Centralized settings for volume management and similar QOL functionality.


## Planned Features:
* Advanced Container Management (Edit/Modify)
* Container Monitoring
* Docker-Compose Compatibility
* Easy access to container interfaces
* User Management

*If you want something that's not planned please open a feature request issue and we'll see about getting it added.*

## Templating:
Currently Yacht is compatible with portainer templates. You'll add a template url in the "Add Template" settings. The the template will be read, separated into apps, and imported into the database. The apps associated with the templates are linked via a db relationship so when the template is removed, so are the apps associated with it. We store the template url as well so we can enable updating templates with a button press.

We recommend starting with: 
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/yacht/Template/template.json
```

In templates you are able to define variables (starting with `!`) to have them automatically replaced by whatever variable the user has set in their server settings (ie. `!config` will be replaced by `/yacht/AppData/Config` by default).
